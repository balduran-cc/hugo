[Apple – Startpage](http://www.apple.com/startpage/ "Apple - Start")

> Let me just say it: We want native third party applications on the iPhone, and we plan to have an SDK in developers’ hands in February. We are excited about creating a vibrant third party developer community around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of new applications for our users. With our revolutionary multi-touch interface, powerful hardware and advanced software architecture, we believe we have created the best mobile platform ever for developers.

本來被質疑 iPhone上是不是只打算開放 widget的開發，現在！情況改觀啦！SDK將在明年二月發佈，屆時期待有五花八門的另類程式被開發出來。

apple最近的小動作真多，看網頁的 banner都放上 10.5 的倒數計時，這實在太讓人銷魂啦。bbs討論的都是現在訂購的機器會不會附贈升級光碟。
